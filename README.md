# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
### Comprehensive Plan

#### Dec 12th - Dec 17th

Implement the following Data Structures with their common methods &
Analyze time and space complexity for each DS's operations

1) ~Linked List~
2) ~Stack~
3) ~Queue~
4) ~BST with BFS and DFS traversal. Inorder, postorder and preorder traversal~
5) Heap (Min, Max)
6) Red/Black, Splay, or AVL -- Implement ONE
7) Graphs - do basics, understand how they can be represented in memory and what
   they are used for. Much more will be done in the Algorithms section.
8) ~Analyze differences between Hash-sets, hash-maps, and hash-tables (Java).
   Exercises will be done in coding section~

#### Dec 18th - 25th (To be planned)

Algorithms such as:

Sorting (plus searching and binary search), Divide-and-Conquer,
Dynamic Programming/Memoization, Greediness, Recursion
or algorithms linked to a specific data structure.

#### Dec 26th - Jan 2nd (To be planned)

Select coding problems
